        <p>Hola. I'm Greg.<br>
            From Brooklyn, NY - based in Madrid, Spain.</p>

        <h3 class="center">About Me</h3>
        <p>After spending years in the New York City restuarant industry, I hit 
        the road and traveled the world for a year and half before finally settling 
        down in Spain.</p><br>
        <p>For the last 6 years, I have called Madrid home, working as an English 
        and Technology teacher in a Bilingual High school.</p><br>
        <p>My passion for language and problem solving has led me to a career in 
        software development.  I love the concept of giving meaning to language; 
        transforming code to beautiful and interactive web pages.  Throughout 
        my time as an educator, as well as traveling, I have continuously worked and 
        collaborated with others to learn, create, and succeed.</p><br>
        <p>When not teaching or learning code, I enjoy:</p></br>
        <ul> <!-- This is an unordered list describing some of my hobbies-->
            <li>traveling and exploring new cultures</li>
            <li>cooking and eating vegan cuisine</li>
            <li>cycling through the city or along the water</li>
        </ul>
